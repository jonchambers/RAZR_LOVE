# RAZR_LOVE
RAZR LOVE is an Internet sketch, Android App and Processing sketch. 
The piece looks at one physical relationship we have with our smartphones 
(constantly tapping and clicking), while aestheticizing the psychedelic 
cultural memory of a media archeological object. 

In order to add more phones to the online version, you must click the mouse vigorously.
